## Cleanup

You have now completed this guide, but you still need to clean up the resources created during this guide. If your account is still in the free tier, it will cost $58.50 / month to run, or 7.8c USD per hour. To remove all the infrastructure you created, use the `cdk destroy` command - this will only remove infrastructure created during this guide. You will see a confirmation:

```
Are you sure you want to delete: InfraStack (y/n)? 
```

After pressing `y` and enter, it will start removing all the infrastructure and provide updates. Once completed, you will see the following:

```
Are you sure you want to delete: InfraStack (y/n)? y
InfraStack: destroying...

 âœ…  InfraStack: destroyed
 ```
